**************************************
CHANGELOG (v5 and above)
**************************************
v5.2
- Reverse() method added to movement scripts, reverse walkers anytime
- Adding PathManagers to WaypointManager at runtime redesigned: you dont
  have to call WaypointManager.AddPath on runtime created paths anymore.
  Also instantiated path names don't have to be unique anymore: they
  will be counted up automatically with a number to make them unique.
- ease type field stays visible when using speed based tweens
- moved navMove agent initialization to Awake for better runtime access
- fixed custom animation curve setting when selecting ease type 'Unset'
- fixed NRE of BezierPathManager when creating bezier paths at runtime
- fixed bezier path handles slowly getting offset when looking around
- DOTween updated to 1.1.310
- Unity 5.4 compatibility

v5.1.1
- fixed initial positioning issue with local walkers on bezier paths
- fixed events not being called on local or repositioned bezier paths

v5.1
BREAKING CHANGES! PLEASE READ CAREFULLY
- removed support for Unity 4.x
- removed bezierMove script! splineMove works on bezier paths now too
- removed manual type selection on MoveAnimator script (automatic now)
- added sample scene "Events" showcasing different event scenarios
- added waypoint rename button on path managers to update waypoint names
- waypoint rename button has a custom checkbox to ignore custom names
- bezier handles on bezier paths are now independent by default
- auto-align bezier points on path creation to create correct curves
- fixed inserting bezier point at last waypoint making it unresponsive
- fixed exception calling CalculatePath() without previous population
- fixed Gizmo scaling getting too large, limited to max size now
- fixed resuming Pause before seconds run out having multiple coroutines
- fixed inconsistent Gizmo drawing on waypoint names and height
- fixed PlayMaker action ChangeSpeed & UpdateBezierPath on every frame
- DOTween updated to 1.1.135

Upgrade guide:
- bezierMove scripts are gone, so if you have been using them in your
  scenes, please replace them with the splineMove movement script.
  Make a backup to easily compare script values during this process.

v5.0.4
- fixed path creation not working in Unity 5.1
- removed automatic renaming of waypoint object names

v5.0.3
- fixed navMove not detecting reached waypoints correctly in Unity 5,
  resulting in skipped waypoints along its path
- fixed navMove throwing NullReferenceException if path is not set
- potentially fixed PathManager NullReferenceException in OnDrawGizmos
- solved a few Unity warnings/errors about version compatibility 

v5.0.2
- DOTween updated to 1.0.720 (Unity 5.0.2 fix)

v5.0.1
- reduced path resolution argument on bezier paths which caused overhead
- DOTween updated to 1.0.291

v5.0
BREAKING CHANGES! PLEASE READ CAREFULLY
- NEW: HOTween has been replaced with DOTween for 400% faster tweens
- NEW: Message functionality has been replaced with built-in UnityEvents
  for specifying target, method, argument in the inspector at waypoints
- NEW: "reverse" checkbox on movement scripts, allows moving in the
  opposite direction on the path on a per-walker basis 
- NEW: "startPoint" variable added on movement scripts, allows
  starting from a different waypoint position on the path3
- NEW: startPoint also works with "moveToPath", e.g. walking directly to
  the third waypoint, then continuing the path as usual
- NEW: included DOTween looptype "Yoyo" which lets your object move on
  the path forwards until the end, then it moves backwards to the start
- NEW: movement script methods: GoToWaypoint(index), Pause(seconds)
- CHANGE: BezierMove events can now be called at waypoints too, the
  setting for messages on percentual path positions has been removed
- CHANGE: "currentPoint" variable is not meant to be modified anymore
  for setting a start position, use the new startPoint variable instead
- CHANGE: minor variable naming adjustments to be in line with DOTween
- CHANGE: method renaming: ResetMove() -> ResetToStart()
- DEL: minimalMove movement script removed, use splineMove instead
- DEL: delay settings removed, use new events and Pause(seconds) instead
- DEL: PlayMaker action SetDelayAtWaypoint is gone, see the sample scene
